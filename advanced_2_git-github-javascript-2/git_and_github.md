# Git & GitHub

Practice repo where we did some exercises: https://github.com/josipgrgic/CWB-practice

## Exercise 1

1. Create a new branch from master - call it branch-{your initials}
2. Create a folder inside the repository called {first_name}-{last_name}
3. Inside it, create an empty JS file
4. Make a commit + push the commit to GitHub
5. Make another commit (put some JS in the file), but donâ€™t push yet!

   - What commits will you see on the local branch? Commit1, commit2, both or neither?

   - What commits will you see on the remote branch? Commit1, commit2, both or neither?

6. Push and create a Pull request
7. After the PR is completed, delete the local and remote branches

## Exercise 2

We will simulate a merge conflict for you to resolve!

1. Create a new branch from master & edit your files and make a commit
2. I will make a new branch where I will edit your files and push the changes to master
   - Will your local branch see the changes I made to your files?
   - Will your remote branch see the changes I made to your files?
3. Merge master into your branch
4. What happened?
5. Resolve the merge conflict, push your changes and create a new PR!
