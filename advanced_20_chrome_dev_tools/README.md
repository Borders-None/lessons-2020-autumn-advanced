## How is it Going?

Any questions or difficulties?
How are you communicating with each other? Did you split your work?
Let's check out some pull requests and active branches

Things to point out:

- Think about encapsulation. Wrap related data in a common div
- You can add people as reviewers of your PR. That way, they get an e-mail notification
- Name your branches sensibly. For example, if you are editing the background image, name it something like `background-image`
- Make your PRs more specific and your commits more atomic. Big PRs or many different tasks in one pull request are generally bad practice

## Next steps

Getting all the books from the REST API:

- First, create a JSON of some books, and write JS to display the book list that way - One PR
- Then, fetch the actual books from the REST API - Another PR
